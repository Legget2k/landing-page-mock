        <h2>The team</h2>
        <p>
          We are a growing team in the process of forming a company dedicated to game development. Our initial goals involve offering a range of creative ideas and mechanics meticulously crafted in the game engine known as GODOT, with various broad and small-scale projects on the design board to deliver enjoyable and imaginative gameplay experiences. Our intention is to provide entertainment that encompasses all the elements of a great game, including music, storytelling, dynamic mechanics, and illustrated graphics to ensure it's engaging.
